            <h2>Wuthering Heights</h2>
            <h5>Emily Brontë</h5><br>
            <p>The Brontë sisters — Anne, Charlotte, and Emily shared both the family talent of literary genius and the tragedy of dying young. Emily Brontë’s only published novel, Wuthering Heights, revels in the stark beauty of the Yorkshire moors in which live two families seemingly doomed to sorrow. The history of the Earnshaw and Linton families crosses with that of the Earnshaw’s foster child, Heathcliff, in a gothic tale full of love powerful enough to defy death itself.</p>
